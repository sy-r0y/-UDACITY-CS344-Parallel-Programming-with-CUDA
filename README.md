With a lot of free time at hand, I've decided to get started with this great course by udacity that teaches fundamentals of massively parallel computing using CUDA C/C++.

The course will use C/C++, will teach me about the CUDA programming environment and use various image processing algos (a'la Instagram) to program and run them on high end GPU's.

Lets get dirty ;)
